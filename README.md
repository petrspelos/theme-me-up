## How's this project going?

~~I just needed this utility and so I put it together in a couple of minutes.~~

The code base has been updated with a proper architecture. It's still not a 100%, but it's getting better.

~~I made this tool for my own use. But who knows, I might get bored and refactor this a bunch. Or you might.~~

Some refactoring has been done, feel free to improve furhter if you're interested. I might, if I'm bored.

Things to improve:

- ~~Switch to wallhaven API~~
- Support all options wallhaven offers for filtering
    - ~~Support for content filters~~
    - Support for pages in the Avalonia UI
- Maybe allow for caching of results
- ~~Support other systems, currently made just for my Elementary OS (will probably run on Ubuntu).`~~
    - Supports Linux with Gnome, and Windows.
- ~~Add support for other wallpaper options in Linux (eg. feh or nitrogen).~~
